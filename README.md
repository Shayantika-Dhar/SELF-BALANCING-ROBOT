# SELF BALANCING ROBOT
  A Self Balancing Robot is creating a robot that is a replica of a human body. Traditional robots consisted of
four wheels, were easily stabilized and comparatively bigger in size. A traditional robot uses four wheels
and four motors for movement, while a self balancing robot uses only two wheels and motors for movement.
A very famous application of the self balancing robot is the Segway. Segway is readily available in market
since 2011 and is also termed as a ― "Human Transporter". It is used mostly to cover shorter distances. It is a
self balancing robot where human weight and angle plays a vital role on controlling the movement of the
Segway. These types of robots are based on the physical theory of inverted pendulum. The system in itself
requires active control in order to be stable. The main aim of this project is to use the self balancing robot to
move small amount of object from one place to another place and detect object in front it.


  The main objective of this project was to learn the underlying concept behind all the self balancing
 robot and also to learn how the PID algorithm works. We used MPU6050 Gyro-sensor which will
 help the robot to balance itself on two wheels. We are creating a Self Balancing Robot by using Arduino Nano. We also used kalma filter
